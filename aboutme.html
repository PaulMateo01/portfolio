    <span>Hi, my name is Paul. My home country is Ecuador, and im planing to visit Ecuador in the summer, with my mom, if not i'll go by myself. I like playing fortnite and I'm pretty good at it, even though I play fortnite a lot my grades are above a B. I also like playing soccer, I hate summer camps, becuase they are pointless over all. My favorite subject is Math and i'm really good at it.</span>
